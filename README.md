# React Pokemon Props Exercise

In this weekâ€™s team session you will practice react basics and you will work on applying the concepts that we have learned throughout the week.

### Instructions:

Fetch the data from a JSON File and pass down the data from the parent component to its child component. Using the data.json you will create a list of pokemons. We've created the necessary components for you, now it's up to you to pass the props properly to these components. Donâ€™t forget the key attribute to avoid any console errors ðŸ˜‰

## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server:

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
